  Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco
  They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo
  You could see me, you can't squeeze me
  I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
  I got reasons why I tease 'em
  Boys just come and go like seasons
  Fergalicious (so delicious)
  But I ain't promiscuous
  And if you was suspicious
  All that shit is fictitious
  I blow kisses (mwah)
  That puts them boys on rock, rock
  And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)</p>
